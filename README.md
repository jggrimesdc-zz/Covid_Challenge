## Background

The COVID-19 Hospital Impact Model for Epidemics) Application is designed to assist hospitals and public health
officials with understanding hospital capacity needs as they relate to the COVID pandemic. This application enables
capacity planning by providing estimates of total daily (i.e. new) and running totals of (i.e. census)
inpatient hospitalizations, ICU admissions, and patients requiring ventilation. These estimates are generated using
a [SIR (Susceptible, Infected, Recovered)](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/SIRModel.html) model, a standard
epidemiological modeling technique.
